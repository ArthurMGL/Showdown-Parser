# Showdown-Parser
Takes the battle log from Pokemon Showdown and records a player's team

Pokemon Showdown is a battle simulator for the Pokemon games. You can access it online here - http://pokemonshowdown.com/

The point of this script was to start gathering usage data for Pokemon Turf Wars, a format created on reddit - http://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTurfWars

To use the text parser simply download the sdparse.py file and run it using your preferred python executor. It runs on python 2.7.8. When it asks if the player you are tracking has point of view, the player who is on the left has point of view. To get text to parse open up a replay (ex: http://replay.pokemonshowdown.com/pokemonturfwars-uu-105 ) and copy all of the text from the side into a text file when you reach the end of the replay.
